# Indie Artist Growth Strategy: "Beyond Fear" Campaign

Led the development and implementation of a comprehensive marketing strategy for indie artist "theo kid" to expand his audience reach and streaming presence. The campaign centered around his emotive single "Blackbird," leveraging its themes of transformation, courage, and natural imagery to connect with targeted listener segments.

With only 287 monthly listeners despite verified artist status, theo kid needed a strategic approach to break through in the crowded indie music landscape while maintaining his authentic artistic identity. Working with a limited £200 promotional budget, we needed to maximize impact across digital platforms.

Approach <br />
Developed a three-stage funnel strategy across Meta platforms and TikTok, focusing on:

- Audience Segmentation: Identified four primary audience segments (Core Music Fans, Mood Listeners, Indie Culture Enthusiasts, Live Music Attendees) with detailed targeting parameters.
- Thematic Creative Direction: Created the "Beyond Fear: The Journey to Flight" creative concept, aligning visual storytelling with the song's emotional arc from hesitation to transformation.
- Multi-Platform Campaign Structure: Designed a progressive campaign moving users from awareness to engagement to conversion, with platform-specific optimizations.
- Budget Optimisation: Strategically allocated the £200 budget with 70% to Meta platforms and 30% to TikTok, with specific reasoning for each allocation decision.

Results  <br />
Note: This campaign was designed but not yet implemented at time of portfolio creation. <br />
The strategy established precise performance metrics targeting:

- Cost per click under £0.50
- Click-through rates above 1%
- Ad frequency under 3
- Optimized cost per stream
