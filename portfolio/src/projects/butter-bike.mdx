This project presents a comprehensive 12-month marketing strategy for Butter Bike, a premium small-batch nut butter brand positioned at the intersection of health, sustainability, and culinary creativity. The strategy focuses on targeted audience segmentation and phased implementation to maximize impact with limited resources

The plan identifies four distinct target demographics—urban food enthusiasts, health-conscious fitness enthusiasts, young professionals, and sustainable living advocates—with tailored approaches for each segment. Each audience received specialized product matching, marketing channel recommendations, and strategic partnerships designed to authentically connect with their specific interests and lifestyles. <br />
Through detailed competitor analysis and phased resource allocation, the strategy creates a sustainable roadmap for growth while maintaining brand authenticity. Key elements include:

* Audience-specific influencer partnership recommendations
* Strategic retail and sampling opportunities
* Channel-appropriate content creation guidelines
* Phased implementation over four quarters with measurable metrics
* Budget allocation guidelines focused on high-impact touchpoints

This strategic marketing plan demonstrates expertise in audience segmentation, market positioning, and resource optimization for premium food brands. The phased rollout approach—starting with urban food enthusiasts, then expanding to fitness communities, young professionals, and sustainability advocates—creates a scalable framework that builds momentum while allowing for measurement and refinement throughout implementation.
