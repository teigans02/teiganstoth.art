# The Fat Duck Group - Marketing Assistant

**Multi-Brand Portfolio Support**  
During my time at The Fat Duck Group, I supported marketing across multiple premium brands, The Fat Duck (3 Michelin stars), The Hinds Head (1 Michelin star), and Heston's personal channels, learning to maintain distinct brand voices while keeping Heston's overall philosophy consistent across every touchpoint.

**Performance Analytics & Business Intelligence**  
I produced monthly reports connecting social media, paid ads, and website performance to tangible outcomes like gift shop revenue and booking conversions, demonstrating that effective marketing at this level requires understanding both the creative storytelling and the operational reality.

**Content Strategy & Production**  
I ran TikTok while supporting Instagram and Facebook, created everything from event materials to strategic pitch decks, and wrote website and newsletter copy. I handled community engagement through DMs and comment responses, ensuring consistent brand voice across all customer interactions.

**Experience-Specific Marketing**  
I developed promotional strategies for The Fat Duck's dining experiences (Top Seat, Mindful, Topsy Turvy, The Journey), learning to position each experience distinctly while maintaining the overarching brand narrative and preserving the magic of the dining experience.

**Strategic Research & Innovation**  
I spent significant time researching how emerging tools like social listening platforms and AI search optimisation could benefit luxury hospitality, learning to think beyond execution toward strategic implementation and exploring new platform opportunities.
