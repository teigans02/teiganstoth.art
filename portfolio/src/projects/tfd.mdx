# The Fat Duck Group

**Company Background**  
A three-Michelin-star restaurant group founded by Heston Blumenthal, comprising The Fat Duck, The Hind's Head, and Heston's personal brand. Each property has its own identity, audience, and tone of voice.

**Content & Social**  
Ran TikTok and supported Instagram and Facebook across the group's brands, writing copy, planning content and managing community engagement through DMs and comments. Working across multiple brands meant maintaining distinct voices for each property while keeping Heston's overall philosophy consistent.

I wrote website copy and newsletters, created event materials, and built pitch decks researching new platforms and tools for the group.

**Dining Experience Campaigns**  
The Fat Duck runs several distinct dining experiences: Top Seat, Mindful, Topsy Turvy, and The Journey. I developed promotional strategies for each, positioning them individually while they all sat under the same restaurant and brand narrative.

**Reporting & Performance**  
Each month I produced reports connecting social media, paid ads and website performance to commercial outcomes like gift shop revenue and booking conversions. Content decisions were always tied back to what was actually driving results.

**Research & Strategy**  
I spent significant time researching how emerging tools like social listening platforms and AI search optimisation could benefit luxury hospitality, thinking beyond execution toward strategic implementation for the group.

**Skills Developed**  
- Multi-brand marketing across luxury hospitality
- Social content strategy and community management
- Performance reporting tied to commercial outcomes
- Campaign development for premium dining experiences
- Platform and emerging technology research
- Brand voice management across distinct propertiesß
