# Marketing & Brand @ Mighty Mouthcare 


Mighty Mouthcare is a climate-minded oral-care start-up tackling the 3 billion toothpaste tubes binned globally every year by replacing single-use plastics with a sleek, refillable dispenser and biodegradable, micro-plastic-free refills.
Independent titles from TechRound and The Grocer have already called the product a UK category first.
In a global oral-care market projected to hit $54 bn by 2030–and where 73 % of consumers say they’ll switch to cut plastic waste–Mighty is skating to the growth puck. >


Hired as the first marketing lead, I was responsible for:
* **Channel strategy** – Paid, organic social, influencers, affiliates, email and SEO.
* **Creative engine** – Figma/Canva for rapid still and video ad creation.
* **UGC & community** – Scaled review, demo and creator pipelines to power always-fresh ad libraries. Set up comprehensive affiliate programme with tiered commission structures and performance tracking.
* **Script/storyboarding** – Developed high-performing hooks and video frameworks for consistent creative output.
* **Meta ads strategy** – Optimised campaign structures, audience targeting, and creative testing for maximum ROAS.
