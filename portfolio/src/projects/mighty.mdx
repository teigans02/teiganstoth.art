# Marketing & Brand @ Mighty Mouthcare 


**Company Background**  
A London-based sustainable toothpaste startup. The brand offers biodegradable refills, dentist-formulated with clean ingredients like papaya enzymes and refreshing English mint oils.  

**Content & Campaigns**  
One of my first moves was sourcing and briefing influencers to kickstart organic awareness. I wrote UGC scripts tailored to different creator personas, making sure each felt authentic, playful, and on-brand. On Instagram and TikTok, I built content strategies designed to educate, entertain, and drive genuine engagement.  

I developed an ongoing educational content series that broke down the benefits of ingredients like papaya enzymes and English mint oils, as well as the impact of choosing refillable over single-use tubes. To make production smoother, I created reusable templates and styling guidelines—building the foundation for consistent, scalable content.  

Video was a big focus too. I produced product videography concepts and directed styling to showcase the brand in a polished yet approachable way.  

A highlight project was the **“Golden Refill” campaign**—a three-week treasure hunt promotion designed to spark buzz and community excitement. I collaborated with a videographer, scripted and directed the founder’s video content, and mapped out teaser strategies to build anticipation. The campaign combined storytelling with interactivity, driving both engagement and awareness.  

To strengthen the value proposition, I also designed comparison campaigns that put our refillable system head-to-head against traditional toothpaste tubes—making the sustainability and convenience benefits impossible to miss.  

**Brand & Research**  
I managed all creative and design work across the brand, producing social assets, infographics, and paid ad materials while keeping everything visually cohesive. Beyond execution, I also set the tone for the brand’s personality: playful, positive, and educational.  

Market research played a big role in strategy. I ran competitor deep dives, analyzed audience behaviors, and identified content gaps that helped shape campaigns. To expand visibility, I led PR outreach—targeting sustainable living bloggers and publications aligned with the brand’s values, and developing platform-specific strategies to meet audiences where they were.  

**Skills Developed**  
- Startup marketing in an early-stage environment  
- Influencer sourcing and UGC strategy  
- Sustainable brand messaging & positioning  
- Multi-platform content creation & adaptation  
- Campaign ideation & execution  
- Independent, remote project management
